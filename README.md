# fantasyrowingdjango

Pretty much all the code is in the "runleague" app. If you can learn to understand django templates and views you'll be able to understand most of the code. Also if you want to see/interact with the website itself you can download the whole repository and run it with django.

I'm trying to keep the repository in a state that it will always run/not crash on certain pages but it's a work in progress so not everything will work 100% of the time.
